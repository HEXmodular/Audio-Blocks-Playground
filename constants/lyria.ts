// This file previously contained LYRIA_MASTER_BLOCK_DEFINITION and LYRIA_PROMPT_BLOCK_DEFINITION.
// These definitions have been migrated to their respective CreatableNode class implementations
// (e.g., services/lyria-blocks/LyriaMaster.ts) or are managed elsewhere.

// LYRIA_SCALE_OPTIONS was also removed as it was part of LYRIA_MASTER_BLOCK_DEFINITION.

// All imports previously here (BlockDefinition, Scale as AppScale, createParameterDefinitions)
// are no longer needed in this file.

// This file can be removed if it no longer serves any purpose, or kept if other
// Lyria-specific constants are expected to be added here in the future.
// Adding a final newline to ensure no parsing issues.
